# Jeremiah Asala - Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Objective:
This is my personal portfolio website made using HTML and CSS.

The goal of this project is to create a space to share a little bit about myself, and highlight some of the coursework and projects I've worked on over the course of three semesters in the Khoury Align MS in Computer Science program at Northeastern University.

Additionally, this project gives me the chance to practice some of the concepts I'm currently learning in my Web Development class. It's a good avenue to practice building basic webpages with HTML and CSS.  

## Languages/Tools:
- HTML5
- CSS
