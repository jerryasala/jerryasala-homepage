          <p class="about-me">
            Before starting the Khoury College master's program, I received a
            bachelor's degree in Neuroscience from the University of Cincinnati,
            where I specialized in Neurobiology on the pre-medicine track. I
            also worked as a medical laboratory technologist for a couple of
            years in between degrees.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me">
            While I enjoyed my work in the healthcare industry, I spent a lot of
            my free time learning how to code, writing computer programs and
            learning about new and emerging technologies. I soon realized that I
            could combine both interests and build a career doing meaningful
            work in the health tech space. That led to my decision to transition
            to the field of technology by pursuing a graduate degree in computer
            science.

          <p class="about-me">
            Talk to me about football! The real football! I enjoy playing and
            watching football (soccer-then emoji) from all of Europe’s top
            football leagues.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me">
            I also enjoy hiking. There’s just something about taking long (and
            often exerting) walks through nature
